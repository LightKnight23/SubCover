# SubCover

This is the official download page for the Subtitle Cover Overlay Android app.

### Focus on the action, not the text. 

SubCover is a simple yet powerful Android utility that lets you hide subtitles in any video player or streaming app. Do you ever find on-screen subtitles distracting? Want to avoid spoilers in the text before the scene plays out? Or maybe you're learning a new language and want to challenge your listening skills without the help of text. SubCover solves this by placing a discreet, customizable bar over the portion of your screen where subtitles typically appear. Because it works as a system-level overlay, it's compatible with virtually any video app.

## Key Features

### •Universal Compatibility: Works on top of your favorite streaming services, local video players, and social media apps.
### •Fully Customizable: Easily adjust the size and on-screen position of the cover bar to perfectly hide the subtitle text in any app.
### •Simple On/Off Control: Start and stop the overlay service with a single tap from the main screen.
### •Quick Visibility Toggle: Instantly hide or show the bar using a persistent notification, without leaving the app you're watching.
### •Lightweight & Efficient: Designed to be minimal and have a negligible impact on battery life and performance.

## How It Works

The app runs a background service to display the overlay. It requires the "Draw over other apps" permission to function, which it will help you enable on the first launch. The service can be stopped at any time from the app or the notification drawer.
